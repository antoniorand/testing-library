Make sure your pull request satisfies the following guidelines:

- For the URL of the framework, you could either use a beginner-friendly tutorial anywhere on the Internet or the official website or the GitHub repo of the framework
- Search for previous successfully merged PR to take as an example before making a new one
- New languages, or improvements are always welcome
- Add your new entry at the bottom within the category
- You could also add a testing tool that is not for a particular programming language too, for instance, Reflect and Cypress
